# Open Source Cartridge Reader
This project represents a community-driven effort to provide an easy to build and easy to modify cartridge dumper.     
Happy making. ðŸ”§ðŸ”¨ðŸ˜Š     

For any questions or issues please also visit the accompanying thread in the [Arduino Forum](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=158974.9001).    
And be sure to check the guides in the [Wiki](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki) too.    

#### Features:  
- Completely stand-alone, does not need a PC to operate (unless for updating firmware)    
- Easy to modify open-source code, write your own extensions and share them with others      
- Portable thanks to a battery  
- Modular design using mostly off-the-shelf components
